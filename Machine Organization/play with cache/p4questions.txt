For all cache simulations, use a capacity of 2 KB, and set associativity of 1, for the D-cache.

Sample command line:
pin-fw/pin -injection child -t pin-fw/source/tools/Memory/obj-ia32/dcache.so -c 2 -a 1 -b <block-size> -o <output-file> -- <your-exe>

1.1 What do you get from running pin with a block size of 4 bytes?

	Data cache misses:
	Data cache references:

1.2 What is the total hit ratio for the D-cache with a block size of 4 bytes (give as a %)?
	

2.1 What do you get from running pin with a block size of 32 bytes?

	Data cache misses:
	Data cache references:

2.2 What is the total hit ratio for the D-cache with a block size of 32 bytes (give as a %)?


3.1 What do you get from running pin with a block size of 64 bytes?

	Data cache misses:
	Data cache references:

3.2 What is the total hit ratio for the D-cache with a block size of 64 bytes (give as a %)?


4. For this question, assume that the 100,000 element integer array that you allocated starts at address 0x50000000 in memory, the size of an integer is 4 bytes and the D-cache is initially empty. As you read the integers in the array one-by-one, starting at index 0, how many D-cache misses will you see for reading the first 40 integers when the cache block size is (to be answered without running pin):

a) 4 bytes:
	
b) 32 bytes:
	
c) 64 bytes:
	
5. For this program, which block size is best? Why? What is the relationship between the blocksize and hit ratio? Why?

8. For this question, assume that the 2-D integer array you allocated starts at address 0x40000000 in memory, the size of an integer is 4 bytes, D-cache block size is 64 bytes and the D-cache is initially empty. As you read the integers in the 2-D array one-by-one, starting with element array[0,0], how many D-cache misses will you see for reading the first 10 integers in case of (to be answered without running pin):

a) cache2Drows:

b) cache2Dcols:

9. Compare the performance (hit ratio) of the D-cache for the 2 programs. Briefly explain what you observe.
